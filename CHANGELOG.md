## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Static HTML export** — download a self-contained `.html` file of your collection (Settings → Stats backup panel, or Share → Static HTML Export). The file embeds all game data and cached cover images as base64, so recipients can open it in any browser with no server, no account, and no network access required. Only games marked "hidden from share" are excluded, consistent with the live share link behaviour.
- **Smooth theme transitions** — switching between dark and light mode now animates instead of snapping. Chrome and Edge use the native View Transitions API for a full-page cross-fade; Safari and Firefox use an opacity fade fallback. Both paths take ~360–380 ms.

### Fixed

- **Backup restore crash** — importing a `.zip` backup via the Settings restore button threw `TypeError: validate_file_extension() missing 1 required positional argument: 'detail'`, making restores impossible. The missing argument has been added.
- **Collection Health score wrong for empty collections** — with no rated games the Avg Rating factor defaulted to 5/10 internally, producing a misleading score of 20/100 and a half-filled bar graph. It now correctly defaults to 0, so a brand-new empty collection shows 0/100.
- **Footer links pointed to old repository** — the GitHub and Report Bug links in the app footer still referenced `cardboard-v2`. Both now point to the correct `cardboard` repository, with the bug report link deep-linking directly to the bug report issue template.

### Changed

- **Collection Health grade label** — the lowest tier (0–39) has been renamed from "Needs Attention" to "Just Starting", and the score-key legend in the info popover updated to match. The previous label was alarming for new users who haven't yet added or played any games.
- **Light mode color palette** — the warm beige (`#dbd4ca`) palette has been replaced with a cool neutral gray (`#eaeaee` base). Text contrast is improved and button/input outlines are sharper against the gray backgrounds.
- **Docker defaults baked into image** — `DATABASE_URL` and `FRONTEND_PATH` are now set as `ENV` defaults in the Dockerfile. Users no longer need to define them in `docker-compose.yml` or `docker run` commands; the correct values for the container's layout are applied automatically. Both can still be overridden if needed (e.g. pointing `DATABASE_URL` at a PostgreSQL instance).
